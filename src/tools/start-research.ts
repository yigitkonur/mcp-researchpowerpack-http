//
// The problem we are guarding against: a single transient LLM failure (one bad
// 429, one malformed JSON response from the classifier) used to poison the
// gate forever and force every subsequent `start-research` call into the
// compact stub — even when env was fine and the next call would have
// succeeded. That created a deadlock where the very tool that could reset
// the health flag was the tool being blocked.
//
// The safer semantics implemented here:
//  1. If env is not configured, we are offline. Hard stop.
//  2. Otherwise, require **two consecutive failures** before gating (one
//     blip is tolerated).
//  3. Even then, the gate only holds for PLANNER_FAILURE_TTL_MS after the
//     most recent failure. After that window we give the planner another
//     chance regardless of the counter — if it is still broken the next
//     call's failure will re-arm the gate.
//  4. Any success resets the counter to 0, so the gate opens immediately
//     on recovery.
