## [3.6.2] - 2026-02-01

### Added

- **Next Steps in Search Results** - Both `search_reddit` and `web_search` now include actionable Next Steps
  - `search_reddit`: Includes ready-to-copy `get_reddit_post` commands with actual URLs from results
  - `web_search`: Includes ready-to-copy `scrape_links` commands with top consensus URLs
  - Both include `deep_research` follow-up suggestions
  - Code block formatting for easy copy-paste

### Changed

- **No Truncation Policy** - Response formatters preserve all content
  - Only header previews use truncation (for display purposes)
  - Full question text, snippets, and URLs are always preserved
  - High-density comprehensive output maintained

## [3.6.0] - 2026-02-01

### Added - Agent-Optimized Response Formatting (70/20/10 Pattern)

- **Standardized Response Format** - All tools now use the 70/20/10 pattern
  - 70% Summary: Key insights, status indicators, metrics
  - 20% Data: Structured results with clear formatting
  - 10% Next Steps: Actionable follow-up commands ready to copy
  - Consistent markdown output across all 5 tools

- **Centralized Utilities**
  - `src/utils/logger.ts` - MCP-compatible logging (uses stderr, never crashes)
    - `mcpLog(level, message, tool)` - Structured logging with emoji prefixes
    - `safeLog()` - Error-swallowing wrapper
    - `createToolLogger()` - Bound logger factory
  - `src/utils/response.ts` - 70/20/10 response formatters
    - `formatSuccess({title, summary, data?, nextSteps?, metadata?})` - Main success response
    - `formatError({code, message, retryable?, howToFix?, alternatives?, toolName?})` - Error with recovery guidance
    - `formatBatchHeader({title, totalItems, successful, failed, ...})` - Batch operation status
    - `formatList()`, `formatDuration()`, `truncateText()` helpers
  - `TOKEN_BUDGETS` constant in `src/tools/utils.ts` for consistent token allocation

- **Improved Error Responses**
  - Structured error format with `code`, `message`, `howToFix`, `alternatives`
  - Retryable errors clearly marked with hints
  - Tool-specific recovery suggestions
  - Alternative tool recommendations on failure

### Changed

- **Response Format** - All tools now return agent-optimized markdown instead of raw JSON
  - `scrape_links` - Added execution time, credits used, next steps with actionable commands
  - `deep_research` - Added question previews, token usage, follow-up suggestions
  - `get_reddit_post` - Standardized batch header, LLM status tracking, recovery hints
  - `search_reddit` - Consistent error formatting with alternatives
  - `web_search` - Added consensus URL counts, next step commands with example URLs

- **Removed Legacy Patterns**
  - Removed per-tool `safeLog()` duplicates (now centralized)
  - Removed per-tool `calculateTokenAllocation()` duplicates (now in utils.ts)
  - Removed `ToolOptions` type with logger/sessionId (simplified signatures)

### Migration Notes

- Tool handlers no longer accept `options` parameter with `logger`/`sessionId`
- All logging now uses `mcpLog()` from `src/utils/logger.ts`
- Response format changed from mixed to standardized markdown
- Old imports still work via re-exports in `src/tools/utils.ts`

## [3.5.1] - 2026-01-31

### Performance

- **Bounded Concurrency** - All parallel operations now use a worker-pool pattern (`pMap`/`pMapSettled`) instead of unbounded `Promise.all`
  - Reddit search: 50 concurrent API calls → 8
  - Web scraping batches: 30 concurrent → 10
  - Deep research questions: unbounded → 3
  - Reddit post fetching: 10 concurrent → 5
  - File attachments: unbounded → 5

- **YAML Config Caching** - `loadYamlConfig()` now caches the parsed YAML in memory instead of reading from disk on every call via `readFileSync`. This eliminates redundant I/O for `getToolConfig()`, `getExtractionSuffix()`, and all config lookups.

- **Async File I/O** - Replaced blocking `existsSync()` in `FileAttachmentService` with async `access()` from `fs/promises` to avoid blocking the event loop.

- **String Concatenation** - Replaced `output +=` loops in `formatCodeBlock()` and `formatAttachments()` with `Array.push()` + `join('')` pattern, eliminating O(n^2) allocations for large files (600+ lines).

- **Module-Level Singletons** - Hoisted `MarkdownCleaner` instance in `scrape.ts` to module level (stateless, reused across requests).

- **Pre-compiled Regex** - Moved Reddit search regex patterns (`/site:\s*reddit\.com/i`, title cleanup regexes) to module-level constants in `search.ts`.

- **Environment Caching** - `parseEnv()` results cached in memory (single read at startup).

### Fixed

- **URL Aggregator Position Logic** - Fixed title/snippet selection in both `aggregateResults()` and `aggregateRedditResults()`. Previously compared against `positions[0]` (first position recorded) instead of the previous best position, which could keep stale metadata when a better-ranked result appeared later.

- **Non-null Assertion Safety** - Replaced `env.SEARCH_API_KEY!`, `env.REDDIT_CLIENT_ID!`, `env.REDDIT_CLIENT_SECRET!` non-null assertions in `registry.ts` with safe `|| ''` fallbacks to prevent runtime crashes if env vars are missing.

- **Reddit Auth Race Condition** - Added promise deduplication (`pendingAuthPromise`) to prevent multiple concurrent `auth()` calls from firing redundant token requests.

### Added

- **`src/utils/concurrency.ts`** - New utility module with `pMap()` (ordered results) and `pMapSettled()` (per-item error isolation) for bounded concurrent execution across the codebase.
